# Data735-Group-Presentation
## What is this
This is the repo for the group assignment for Data735 at Queens College with Prof. Rhindress. The objective of this assignment is to determine what are the real reasons people choose a mode of transportation. We opted to create random observations to do the analysis on. The technique we chose to use was [Dominance Analysis](https://dominance-analysis.github.io/dominance-analysis/) proposed by Azen and Budescu (2003).
## How did we do it
We used the [Dominance Analysis](https://dominance-analysis.github.io/dominance-analysis/) library.
